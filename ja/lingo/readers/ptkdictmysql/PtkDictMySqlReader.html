    <b>PtkDict MySQL format</b> was first introduced in <a href="http://swaj.net/ptkdic/">PtkDict</a>
    application, which used pre-installed MySQL server as a storage for its dictionaries.<br>
    The dictionaries were distributed as dump files which are
    produced by <i>mysqldump</i> command.<br>
    <br>
    <a href="http://phpmylingvo.sourceforge.net/">phpMyLingvo</a> is
    another, web-based application which also uses MySQL server to store dictionaries.<br>
